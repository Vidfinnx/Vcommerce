  # Description
  E-Commerce Backend System Using `MySQL2` , `Express` ,  `Node.js` , `Dotenv`,  `Sequelize`
  
  Not everything is exactly how i wanted it to function but i got pretty darn close in the feedback i wanted the user to receive
  when testing.

  I just ran out of time but i will be revisiting this in the future!

  - Open Terminal `Npm install`
  - Open Mysql in terminal ` CREATE DATABASE ecommerce_db;` OR Load Schema.sql into SQL Workbench software
  - Create .env file and put your SQL credentials inside it
